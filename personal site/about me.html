  <h2 class="descrip descrip2">My story</h2>
  <p class="text about"> I see you want to know how I got here, well I'll tell you. My name is Brooklyn Khumalo and this is my story.
<br>
<br>
It was in sports science class where we were on the topic of motivation. We were asked to go home and watch this famous inspirational sports video called “facing the giants: death crawl scene”. So I did that however I spiraled into the inspirational sphere. I watched way too many videos until one channel called "be inspired" made me realize that I was doing nothing with my life.
All I did back then was get home, game, and maybe study. I never even went into my passion called tricking as I was barely training once a week and even though I kinda liked programming I never bothered.
<br>
<br>
No more. I couldn't just sit back and not do anything with my life. So from that day forward, I started to develop myself. I realized that I love tricking as the way I moved my body made me feel the happiest I've ever felt so I went full-in and made a goal so high that I had to maybe work for decades to land it. That is why gainer switch swing through triple cork exists.
After years of only Tricking I didn't care what other things I could be doing as I never cared until this year where I felt I could be doing so much more for others. That's when I realized I want to help people the only way I could think of, programming, I even tried to make a tricking app via programming to help although that failed due to lack of commitment I tried again. I enhanced my goal to make it the most challenging goal I could think of and that's where my planet-scale project comes from.
<br>
<br>
So now you know why I am here. I want to show myself that I can achieve something for myself, that I can add value on such a scale that some could even consider impossible and this website is the start of that. I am utilizing this website to document my progress for my two goals.
You should know that I only believe in 2 things. One is that I know that I have to put in an insane amount of work to win, two is that I'd rather set the bar insanely high and fail than set the bar insanely low and succeed.  No matter the cost, I am doing whatever it takes!

Thank you for reading :D
